Runtime release gate, unified drizzle-kit migrations, and richer relations:

- **Golden-path runtime smoke**: the release workflow now boots a scaffolded app and drives login, CRUD, CSRF, and auth rejection over HTTP before publishing — the class of published-artifact-only breakage fixed in rc.20 can no longer ship.
- **Migrations unified on drizzle-kit**: `createSqliteDatabase`/`createPostgresDatabase`/`createMySqlDatabase` now expose `resetDatabase()` and `migrationStatus()`, making `guren db:reset`, `db:fresh`, and `db:status` work out of the box (all three previously failed on scaffolded apps). `db:rollback` now explains that drizzle-kit migrations are forward-only and points to `db:reset` or a compensating forward migration; the dead flat-SQL rollback tracker was removed.
- **Relations**: nested eager loading with dot notation (`User.with('posts.comments')` — previously documented but not implemented) and `withCount()` (`users[0].postsCount`) for hasMany/hasOne/belongsTo/morphMany. Relation declarations no longer need `typeof` guards or `as any` casts; the testing mocks now include relation registrars so model modules load cleanly under Vitest.
- Templates export `resetDatabase`/`migrationStatus` from config/database.ts and ship `db:reset`/`db:status` scripts; relationship docs updated (EN/JA) with the clean declaration pattern and `withCount`.

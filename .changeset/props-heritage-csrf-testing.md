Second round of real-app (Kadai) fixes:

- **@guren/cli codegen: inherited page props are no longer dropped.** `interface Props extends PaginatedPageProps<T> { ... }` now extracts as an intersection of the heritage clauses and the body. Previously only the body was captured — an empty-bodied extends silently degraded the page contract to `{}` (no type checking at all), and adding any own member made the inherited members vanish from the contract, rejecting valid controller props.
- **@guren/testing: `TestApp.withCsrf()`** primes CSRF like a real browser — GETs a page, captures the session and XSRF-TOKEN cookies, and sends them (plus `X-XSRF-TOKEN`) on subsequent requests, so mutating endpoints are finally testable against apps with CSRF enabled.
- **@guren/orm: `GUREN_QUIET_DUPLICATE_ORM=1`** silences the duplicate-copy warning for environments where two copies coexist by design (e.g. monorepo dev with src + dist).

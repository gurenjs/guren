Three bug fixes ahead of 1.0:

- **Nested eager loading now works at any depth** (#15). `User.with('posts.comments.author')` previously loaded two levels and silently left deeper relations unloaded when going through the query builder. `QueryBuilder` now delegates the full dotted path to `Model.loadRelationInto`, which recurses correctly.
- **Auth context is available to middleware registered before `boot()`** (#13). The fallback auth context (apps without `options.auth`) is attached in the `Application` constructor, and the context resolves its session lazily — so `app.use(requireAuthenticated())` before `boot()` responds 401 instead of throwing, regardless of session middleware ordering.
- **Route contracts accept array-style query strings** (#12). `?tag=a&tag=b` now reaches query schemas as `{ tag: ['a', 'b'] }` (single occurrences stay plain strings), matching the controller-side `validateQuery` behavior. Schemas that expect a plain string for a key clients may repeat should switch to `z.array(...)` or accept both.

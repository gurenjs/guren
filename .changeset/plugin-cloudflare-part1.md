Added `@guren/plugin-cloudflare` — the Cloudflare Workers deploy adapter (RFC 0003 Part 1). `createWorkersHandler(app)` wraps a Guren `Application` in a Workers module handler with lazy, deduplicated boot on the first request (bindings arrive with `fetch`, so boot cannot run at module scope) and passes each request's `env`/`ExecutionContext` through to Hono untouched. `getWorkersEnv<Env>()` exposes the first request's bindings to boot-time config behind a write-once holder, and `guren cloudflare:build` assembles a deployable `.cloudflare/` directory: the app's canonical build, a generated worker entry that statically wires the built SSR bundle, copied static assets for Workers Static Assets, and a `wrangler.jsonc` scaffold (D1 binding, `nodejs_compat`, drizzle migrations dir).

Supporting additions: `setInertiaSsrRenderer()` in `@guren/server` registers a process-wide default SSR renderer (per-call `ssr.render` still wins) so filesystem-free runtimes can use a static import instead of the `GUREN_INERTIA_SSR_ENTRY` dynamic import, and `TestApp.fromWorkers(handler, { env })` in `@guren/testing` drives a Workers-style handler with a fake `ExecutionContext` for testing the lazy-boot lifecycle.

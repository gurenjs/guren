Guard OAuth `redirectTo` against open redirects. State creation and verification both sanitize the value: app-relative paths always pass, absolute URLs only when their host is in the new `stateConfig.allowedRedirectHosts` allowlist (wildcards supported); protocol-relative URLs, backslash variants, and non-http schemes are dropped. New `OAuthManager.handleCallback()` returns the profile together with the sanitized `redirectTo`, and `sanitizeOAuthRedirect()` is exported for custom flows. The `guren add oauth` scaffold now demonstrates the safe round-trip (`?redirectTo=` → `handleCallback`).

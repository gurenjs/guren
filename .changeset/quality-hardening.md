Quality hardening: database-matrix runtime gates, upgrade-path protection, and add-on runtime smokes:

- **PostgreSQL golden-path gate**: the scaffold→auth→CRUD runtime smoke now also runs against PostgreSQL in CI and the release workflow (dedicated `guren_smoke` database locally so developer data is never touched), verifying dialect-aware scaffolds, `resetDatabase()`, and `migrationStatus()` on pg for every release.
- **`guren upgrade` works for the rc channel**: previously only `--canary` was supported, leaving rc users with no tool-assisted upgrade. `guren upgrade` now aligns every `@guren/*` package to a resolved dist-tag version (default `rc`, override with `--tag`), and warns when nested duplicate `@guren` copies survive in node_modules with the exact dedupe command.
- **Duplicate-copy runtime guard**: loading two copies of `@guren/orm` (mixed versions) now prints a loud diagnostic explaining why database access fails and how to fix it, instead of failing silently with "database has not been configured".
- **`Mail#build()` runs automatically**: scaffolded mailables previously threw "Email must have a subject" because `send()`/`queue()` never invoked `build()` — every user following the `add mail` scaffold hit this. Found by the new add-on runtime smoke, which now dispatches the scaffolded queue job and sends the scaffolded mailable on every release.
